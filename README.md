## Why Open Source now?

You know, I'm the laziest developer on earth and I'm pissed about the app now, so do whatever you want!
No, that was just a JOKE!

I believe in OPEN SOURCE, I believe, that apps will get better when they are open source and there's a community, which likes to contribute. And because I don't need yet, I thought "What could go wrong? - Nothing.".

## How can YOU contribute?

Some things you can help with:

- Translate the app's strings
- Improve the app's design
- Fix bugs I didn't found
- And more!

_An better description will follow soon..._
